                  “Hats off to Dan Evans and his staff for a smooth and
                  successful transaction in selling our property in Awbrey
                  Butte. At our request, Dan developed a strategy for getting
                  the property sold quickly. The strategy worked better than we
                  had expected and the property sold for full asking price in
                  under 30 days. Dan’s emphasis on continuous communication
                  allowed us to focus our energies on other priorities during
                  the entire transaction. Our place sold without any hassles
                  which we really appreciate. You put in that extra effort which
                  many times goes unnoticed…but we did! Thanks for doing such a
                  WONDERFUL JOB!!!” — John & Tara Ballantine

Dan is extremely professional and knowledgeable in the real estate business. I really appreciate the hard work and effort Dan put into this real estate transaction.” — Robert West

After working with Dan, we can both honestly say that they were wrong. Not only was Dan very professional and prompt day in and day out, but very personal as well. He is a very intelligent and hard working person with attention to specific details for each customer he provides service to. I don’t think that the process would have flowed like it did without Dan. I know that when we are ready to purchase our next house we’ll call up Dan in a heartbeat, because why look for something or someone better when you already have the best?” — Amelia Herrera & Chris Barrett

We had sold homes on our own in the past; Dan was respectful of that and offered his help if we decided we needed it. From the beginning, Dan “stood out from the crowd” as a quiet, genuine, unassuming person. When it became clear we could not devote the time needed to sell by owner, we called on Dan, and are thankful we did. Dan is a knowledgeable, hard-working professional. He consistently kept us up to date with market data and activity on our house. He was always accessible and responsive, and a welcome source of advice when it came time to evaluate multiple offers and negotiate with buyers. We recommend Dan highly, without hesitation.” — John & Suzanne Brauer

                  “During 2003, our home was listed in excess of seven months with two different, large, many agent and broker companies. Each company had their preview of the property with good attendance. However, none of those many people ever showed the house. Our lesson in Bend is that large real estate companies do not have agents that work together. We should have listed with a smaller, professional company to begin with. Again, thank you for your excellent service and professionalism.” — Joseph Sargis

                  “Now, on the other side of selling and buying a home for the first time, I have gained some wisdom. One piece of wisdom is to say I am thrilled to have had Dan Evans represent me in selling my home in Bend, Oregon. I moved out of the area four weeks into putting my property up for sale and practically left my home into Dan’s hands. He took care of all of the details needed to be done to successfully sell and close my home that I couldn’t get to because of geographical distance. I don’t know what I would have done without Dan’s expertise and willingness. He is an intelligent man with a gift for financial strategies, a true professional with a sense of humor, and a genuine humanitarian who is willing to pull up his sleeves and get dirty to help tidy the loose ends to sell your home. Dan goes the extra mile. He is someone you can call “friend” at the end of a process that can be very exhausting! I would recommend Dan Evans in a second!” — Saundra Caron
